		<h2>Prologue</h2>
      <p>In the Prologue, the party is introduced to a number of important characters and story elements, as well as the overarching plot; the oncoming darkness.</p>
      <p>The party first encounters a great astral rift at an old war site. The rift is a remnant of the Rift War, where the world's arcana began to destabilize following the resurrection and rise to power of Vatia, the God of Vengeance, fueled by the dark powers of a shard of destruction. Vatia was finally slain in a great marble tower in the southern desert.</p>
      <p>While investigating the issues plaguing the port city of Tal'vosk, the party encountered Althus the Enchantress, who sought to draw a darkness upon Sokopin by sowing death on a grand scale. The party defeated Althus, but not in time to stop her, and with her now dead, any information she might have had was also lost.</p>
      <p>At the advice of Tal'vosks Chancellor of Arcana, the party heads to the great elven capital of Anor to meet with a man who is supposed to know more. An elven bladesinger named Fenelor.</p>
	  <h2>Intermission One: Ironhaven</h2>
		<p>The party passes through Ironhaven, a mining town run by a party of former adventurers. A mystic, a cleric, and artificer, and a bard.</p>
		<p>It was revealed that a divine presence, the light god Savere, lurked within the mind of the mystic, unable to overtake the host due to his impressive willpower.</p>
		<p>While staying in the town, the party was told by Savere to release an ancient dragon, which set upon the region.</p>
		<p>The mystic slew the dragon, saving the town, but disappeared in doing so, and is presumed dead.</p>
		<p>The mountain behind Ironhaven was cut in two by the mystic's attack, leaving twin split peaks in its place. This event will surely be the inspiration for many a fanciful tale in the years to come.</p>
		<h2>Chapter One: The Absent Tower</h2>
		<p>Soon after arriving in Anor, the party meets with a druid named Elandor, who tells them of the Rift War in the 4th era, and offers them a spell that will help them.</p>
	  <p>Then, the attempts to make contact with Fenelor, but is intercepted by a courier claiming to be an associate of his; a duergar named Beldar.</p>
		<p>Beldar offers the party a task; to investigate the ancient tower of Vatia, the God of Vengeance. Here the party will learn more about the approaching darkness.</p>
	  <p>In the interim of their return to meet Beldar again, the party seeks out a number of side quests. </p>
	  <p>Their travels would take them to meet a legendary blacksmith, only to find that he has passed away, and his apprentice is less than cooperative.</p>
		<p>And to the town of Ashbourne, the corrupt mayor of which has recently been deposed, and replaced by a mysterious swordsman. </p>
	  <p>And then to the great trading port of Marren's Eve, where the party bought some supplies, and discovered a fallen star. </p>
	  <p>Upon their return to Anor, they met with Beldar once more, who led them to a strange building in the residential district, where they finally met Fenelor. </p>
